# **<p align="center"> Classification Challenge </p>**

In this challenge, the csv file for spam data is analyzed. 

- The data is first loaded as a data frame and it is splitted for training and testing.   
- Using the standard scalar method, the data data is fitted and trained. 
- Created a Logistic Regression model and did predictions for the scaled data. The accuracy score for the logistic regression model is 92%
- Created a Random forest model and fif predictions for the same scaled data. The accuracy score for this model is 96%
- The Random forest model gives better predictions compared to linear regression model as the accuracy score is higher.
